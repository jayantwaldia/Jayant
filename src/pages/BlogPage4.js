      <p className="Description">
        Getting back to my hometown in Pithoragarh, Uttarakhand has always been
        a resourceful experience for me and I must recommend you if you wish to
        explore the Kumaon region, and rest assured it will always give you a
        type of experience that you can meditate on forever!

            To what I observed after 9 years of the span is that the place is
            turning out to be a gold mine for the tourist and travelers in the
            upcoming years, once the roadways and the airways services will take
            a yet to be achieved better form. This will be good in terms of the
            new employment and business forms introducing every single day in
            the valley, but eventually, it will and currently is causing the
            aftermaths like increased asphalt, vehicle count, overcrowded
            roads/markets, and the huge amount of garbage and plastic inside the
            valley. The place is accessible by car, bus, and now including
            airplane services owned by private firms at a very cheap rate. It's
            Uttarakhand’s very own “Little Kashmir”, owing to its vast natural
            beauty and scenic landscapes.

            Located approx 500 km from New Delhi, and lies on the Indo-Nepal
            border. The destination, however, is worth the thirteen-hour long
            bus journey, as it opens up to you a new realm of magnificent
            valleys, plateaus, and the majestic Himalayas and is located in the
            middle of four mountains, namely Kedar, Chandak, Kumar, and Dhwaj
            and has plenty of nature’s bounties to capture for to wonder when
            the Himalayan Vultures would show up!!

              So what's actually changing about the Himalayas?

            The recent disaster in Uttarakhand has once again turned the
            spotlight on climate change and its impact on ecology. On February
            7, 2021 a portion of the Nanda Devi glacier broke off, leading to
            severe floods which washed away villages and damaged power plants.
            Around 200 people are still missing, and many of them are now feared
            dead.

            Climate change in Uttarakhand will increasingly force people to
            abandon farming at high altitudes and move to the plains over the
            next 30 years. Uttarakhand, which covers an area bigger than Costa
            Rica, maybe 1.6 degrees Celsius-1.9 degrees Celsius warmer by 2050.
            Its residents are already experiencing the impacts of climate
            change, such as changing temperatures, upward-moving snowlines,
            receding glaciers, erratic rainfall, reduction of snow in winter,
            changed cropping seasons, shifting cultivation zones for certain
            crops, and drying up of perennial streams, as pointed out in the
            state government’s action plan on climate change.

            Though the actual cause of the glacier burst is being probed,
            scientists for long have warned that glaciers are disappearing from
            the Earth and global warming, especially in the last three decades,
            is a major reason behind it. As the world is getting hotter, ice
            caps on mountains are melting rapidly.
