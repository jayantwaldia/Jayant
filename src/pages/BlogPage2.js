            Maybe all of this, cafes, malls or social media sites is a setup or
            a delusion waiting to shelter anyone from hard, scary or better to
            be called red pill aspects of life.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            Not in literal sense but the idea of this whole set up always makes
            me question the unnecessary options that I have availed for myself
            and for my consumption.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            It's not that I cannot afford it with my time and money but why to
            numb myself from all these empty pleasures to join the numb masses.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            And this question further leads me towards taking a step back and to
            abandon all these abundances to feast upon what I already have.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            All of this is not in literal sense and I am just highlighting the
            stupid structural idea of “ignore the rest”, which makes the world
            an ignorant place and an ignorant place is for sure a messed up
            place.
