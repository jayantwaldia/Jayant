            Maybe all of it is a setup or a delusion waiting to shelter anyone
            from hard, scary or better to be called real realities of life.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            Not in literal sense but the idea of this whole set up always makes
            you question the unnecessary options that you have availed for
            yourself and for your consumptions.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            It's not that you cannot afford it with your time and money but why
            to numb yourself from all these empty pleasures to join the numb
            masses.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            And this question further leads you towards taking a step back and
            to abandon all these abundances to feast upon what you already have.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            Again all of this is not in literal sense and I am just highlighting
            the stupid structural idea of “ignore the rest” ideology, which
            makes the world an ignorant place and an ignorant place is for sure
            a f*cked up place.
