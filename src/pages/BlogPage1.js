      <p className="Description">
        The constant compulsion to chase and achieve the ceaseless standards of
        aesthetics on internet is eroding your identity in the most unimaginable
        ways possible. <br></br>
        <br></br>
        <span style={{ color: "white" }}>
          Being Yourself is not an act, it’s a whole damn career.

            People who are less willing to share their life or daily doings on
            social media usually live the most Instagramable life tbh, unhooked
            and unbothered...
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            It’s a muscle worth training coz every time you decide to pick out
            the phone from your pocket the visual state of appreciation is
            ruined and lost.
          </li>

          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            Social media has allowed people to see what’s out there. Inspired
            all of us to win. But the insidious byproduct is making many forget
            what they truly want out of life. Takes incredible levels of
            self-awareness to know if the path you’re going down is your dream
            or someone else’s.
          </li>
          <li style={{ marginTop: "50px" }}>
            At the end of the day either "your life can look cool" or "your life
            is cool" Can't be both, It’s a choice that we have to make.
