            Consistency feeds on variations. And at some point, it demands more
            of it. The idea is to be brave enough to abandon our current beliefs
            or ideas and pick up on new variations which deems fit to be a part
            of your moral trajectory. Bend it, amend it.

            personalize the situation to myself.
