          You don't need to be the hardest person to convince yourself and the

            Consistency feeds on variations. And at some point, it demands more
            of it. The idea is to be brave enough to abandon our current beliefs
            or ideas and pick up on new variations which deems fit to be a part
            of your moral trajectory. By bending it and amending it.

            Uncertainty isn’t a failing. It’s rather a projection of your
            alignment with your realities.

            Natural hardships aren't punishments nor do you own them. Making
            peace with a lot of things today that are not in your control right
            away in the happening will actually help you not to victimize or
            over personalize the situation to yourself.
